ETHICAL HACKING


EXERCISES FOR ADVANCED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING COURSE


 1.GIT

For GIT,I have used frequent push,pull,commit and other frequently used commands in this repo.I have randomly used a few commmands that may have just been for practice that were not necessarily asked in the exercises. I have attached my Git command history here- https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/.bash_history A few of the other not so related to the project commits are https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/hotel1.txt , https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/houses.txt , https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/rollno.txt , https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/surnames.txt . 


2. UML

For the second task, I have created 3 UML diagrams.

  a)The first is the Sequence diagram https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/hack1.PNG which represents the sequence of messages that are shared or exchanged between the objects represented in the diagram.
  
  b)For the second diagram I have shown a Use Case diagram https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/hack2.PNG which graphically represents a user's possible interractions with a system.
  
  c) Finally, for the third case, I have chosen the Activity diagram https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/hack3.PNG which represents the behavior of the components in a system.It gives us an overview of how the workflows.
  
  
  3.DDD
  
  For the DDD, I decided to go for another domain since my domain was too small to be represented and broken into sub-domains. I chose the banking system as it seemed very intersting to me to learn as well as document the relationship between the numerous sub domains involved in the same. Firstly, I drew a diagram which depicts the different sub domains of the banking domain- https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/ase1.PNG
  Secondly, I have drawn the DDD using bounded context where different relationships are between the subdomains.
