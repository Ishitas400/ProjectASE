EXERCISES FOR ADVANCED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING COURSE


1.Git 

For GIT,I have used frequent push,pull,commit and other frequently used commands in this repo.I have randomly used a few commmands that may have just been for practice that were not necessarily asked in the exercises. I have attached my Git command history here- https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/.bash_history A few of the other not so related to the project commits are https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/hotel1.txt , https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/houses.txt , https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/rollno.txt , https://github.com/Ishitas400/ProjectASE/blob/main/surnames.txt .
